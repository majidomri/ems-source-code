          <p>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
          <p>
            This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that
            all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not
            as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read
            it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by
            following the opt out procedure described below. Informal Process
            First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and
            Five39 Enterprises, you will first contact Five39 Enterprises and
            make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before
            resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without
            limitation any court action <br />
            Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process
            any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”)
            relating in any way to your use of Five39 Enterprises services
            and/or products, including the Easymatri Matrimonial will be finally
            resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration
            agreement applies equally to you and Five39 Enterprises. However,
            this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Five39
            Enterprises for infringement of its intellectual property or access
            to the Easymatri Matrimonial that is unauthorized or exceeds
            authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use
            of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If
            you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement
            within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use
            the Easymatri Matrimonial by following the procedure described
            below. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
            interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and
            Five39 Enterprises are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or
            to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will
            survive any termination of these Terms.
            <br />
            If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the
            informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter
            requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the Legal
            Department of Five39 Enterprises via the below channels (email:
            legal@Easymatri.com, or address: musical.ly Inc. 10010 Venice Blvd.,
            Suite 301, Culver City, CA 90232). The arbitration will be
            administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its
            rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA’s Supplementary
            Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an
            individual or have used the Easymatri Matrimonial on behalf of an
            entity, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
            Disputes will not be used. The AAA’s rules are available at
            www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing,
            administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s
            rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the
            Easymatri Matrimonial on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse
            those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than
            $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous,
            and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless
            the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. <br />
            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will
            have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
            interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability,
            enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement,
            including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration
            agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will
            not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below. If you do not
            want to arbitrate disputes with Five39 Enterprises and you are an
            individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending
            a notice via email: legal@Easymatri.com within thirty (30) days of
            the first of the date you access or use the Easymatri Matrimonial .
            <br />
            Class Action Waiver: Any Claim must be brought in the respective
            party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member
            in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple
            plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties
            expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any
            forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will
            not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct
            any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a
            party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class
            Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable
            may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not
            by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate
            in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a
            party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any
            claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the
            entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will
            be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only
            to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s
            individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather
            than in arbitration, you and Five39 Enterprises each waive any right
            to a jury trial
